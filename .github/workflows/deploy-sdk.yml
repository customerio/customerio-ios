      #    in this deployment, semantic release will automatically determine the version is 1.4.0 for this new release you're doing.
      #    Semantic release is able to do this by viewing commit messages since the last release. That's why this project uses a
      #    specific commit message format during pull requests.
      # 2. Updates metadata files. Such as updating the version number in package.json and adding entries to CHANGELOG.md file.
      # 3. Create git tag and push it to github.
