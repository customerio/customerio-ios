        message: |
          A new branch (`${{ env.BRANCH_TO_CREATE_SIMULATING_MERGE }}`) has been automatically created which simulates what would happen to git commit history if this PR got merged. 

          A new CI workflow (`test-deployment`) has been started. This message *should* automatically be updated with the progress of that workflow. If you see this message for longer then a few minutes, then there might have been an issue with starting the workflow. [Link to CI server logs](${{ steps.current-job.outputs.html_url }}) for starting the new workflow.
