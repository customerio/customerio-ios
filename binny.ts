/**
 * This is a script designed to run on a local development machine as well as CI server to install and run CLI tools that are used by this project. 
 * The problem that we need to solve is that iOS/Swift development tools today don't have a good way to install and execute versioned binary tools used for development. 
 * Instead, tools are mostly installed via Homebrew or manually by all developers and CI servers. This then causes the issue of everyone being on a different version of each tool, causing issues when using the tools. 
 * 
 * This tool as the following responsibilities:
 * 1. Defines what tools this project uses and what version of the tool that needs to be used. 
 * 2. Downloads the tool automatically for you if it's not installed already. Or, if the tool is out-of-date, it will download the latest version of the tool.
 * 3. Runs the tool with the correct version.
 * 
 * If you want to update the version of a tool to a newer version, simply update the version number in the toolsUsedInProject array below and push a commit to the repo. Then, all developers and CI servers will automatically download the new version the next time they execute this script.
 * 
 * This script is written in TypeScript and uses Deno as the runtime. In order to execute this script, you need to have Deno installed (brew install deno), or we can compile this script into a binary and run it that way.
 * Command to run this script: deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run binny.ts swiftlint --strict 
 * Command to compile this script into a binary: make compile_run_tool
