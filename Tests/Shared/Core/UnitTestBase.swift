/// Serves as the base class for all tests within the SDK, offering common setup, teardown, and

/// mock objects, test data, and other shared resources, ensuring a consistent testing environment and
/// minimizing boilerplate in individual test cases.
///
/// The generic `Component` parameter represents the module interface, providing convenient and direct access
/// to the module's public APIs being tested. `Component` can be specified as the SDK (e.g., `CustomerIO`)
/// or a specific module (e.g., `MessagingPush`).
///
/// For SDK-wide tests, child classes can conveniently inherit from `UnitTest`, designed specifically for testing only SDK APIs.

    /**
     Performs initial setup before the execution of each test method in the test class.

     This method should be overridden to include any setup logic required before each test.
     Call the base implementation in `UnitTestBase` with `super.setUp()` to ensure proper setup, as shown below:

     ```
     override func setUp() {
       super.setUp()    // <-- calls the base class setup

       // insert setup logic here.
     }
     ```

     To skip the default setup in order to modify SDK/module settings directly within the test function,
     `setUp` can be overridden as empty, without calling `super.setUp()`, like this:

     ```
     override func setUp() {
         // intentionally empty to skip default setup
     }
     ```

     Then, customize the SDK/module configuration in test function as follows:

     ```
     override func setUp() {
         super.setUp(modifySdkConfig: { config in    // <-- calls the base class setup and modifies config
             config.autoTrackDeviceAttributes = false
         })

         // additional setup logic here.
     }
     ```

     @param enableLogs Enables logging for the test class. Can be useful for debugging. Disabled by default as it's too noisey and unhelpful when logs are enabled for all tests.
     @param modifySdkConfig Closure allowing customization of the SDK/Module configuration before the SDK/Module instance is initialized.
