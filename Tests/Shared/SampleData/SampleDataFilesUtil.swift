// Class that interacts with static files stored in SampleDataFiles resources directory.
//
// Instead of storing long Swift Strings full of data, we store static files in a directory in the Tests/ directory.
// Then, we can read in those files as Strings and use them in test functions.
//
// One common use case of using these static files is to save the file into the FileSystem of the app running during the
// test.
// That means that at runtime in tests, when `FileManager` in the SDK runs, it can read files just like it's running an
// an iOS app.
//
// In order to obtain sample files:
// 1. Plug iPhone into your Computer.
// 2. Run a sample iPhone app to make it save files that you care about into the app's file storage.
// 3. Open Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators > Select your iPhone that's plugged in > Select app in Installed App
// section > Select "..." icon > Download container.
// 4. You can now browse the files saved to the app. Copy and paste files from there that you care about.
