# Swiftlint rules that are only applied to files in the Tests directory. 
# When writing tests, there are some lint rules that are less important to follow then the source code that customers use. 

# This file inherits rules from the base `.swiftlint.yml` file while overriding rules specified in this file. 

disabled_rules:
  # try! in a test can result in tests being halted and not finish executing. Instead, we would rather have a test fail and continue executing the suite. 
  # Instead of try!, use:
  # let foo = try? ...
  # XCTAssertNotNil(foo)
  # XCTAssertEqual(foo?.bar, "")
  # - force_try

  # `as!` in a test can result in tests being halted and not finish executing. Instead, we would rather have a test fail and continue executing the suite. 
  # Instead of `as!` use: 
  # let foo = ... as? ABC
  # XCTAssertNotNil(foo)
  # XCTAssertEqual(foo?.bar, "")
  # - force_cast

  # Test classes that contain lots of unit test methods will throw this lint error. 
  # That's not necessarily a bad thing to have lots of unit test functions so this error is OK to ignore 
  # for tests.
