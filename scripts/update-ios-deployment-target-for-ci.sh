# Script to temporarily update iOS deployment target in Package.swift for CI testing
# 
# Context: Firebase 12+ requires iOS 15+ minimum deployment target, but our SDK supports iOS 13+.
# This script allows CI to run tests with iOS 15+ while keeping SDK's public API at iOS 13+.
# 
# This script:
# 1. Validates that Package.swift currently has exactly ".iOS(.v13)" 
# 2. Temporarily updates it to ".iOS(.v15)" for CI testing
# 3. Fails if the current value is anything other than ".iOS(.v13)" to prevent accidental changes
#
# Usage: ./scripts/update-ios-deployment-target-for-ci.sh

set -e  # Exit on any error
