            We're excited to have you onboard as we explore the walk through the capabilities of
            **Customer.io** within the realm of spacial computing generally and VisionPro specifically.

            This sample app is more than just a demonstrationâ€”it's a hands-on guide
            designed to familiarize you with **Customer.io Swift SDK**. You'll learn not only how to integrate the SDK into your VisionPro app but also how
            it contributes to leveraging **Customer.io**'s marketing prowess to enhance the user engagement.

            **P.S.:** For those eager to jump straight into the code,
            the `MainScreen.swift` file in the sample app provides a quick overview of the `CustomerIO` class in action.

            Ready to embark on this immersive journey? Let's start by
            [installing CustomerIO SDK](\(InlineNavigationLink.install))
