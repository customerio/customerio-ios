     Thread-safe method to check if a push event has been handled before.

     If the push has not been handled before, it will be marked as handled. This is to prevent race conditions. Code such as this may have a race condition bug that we want to prevent:

     ```
     let hasPushBeenHandled = pushHistory.hasHandledPush(pushId)
     if !hasPushBeenHandled {
       pushHistory.markPushAsHandled(pushId)
     }
     ```
     By having 1 thread-safe function perform the check and mark, we can prevent this scenario.

     @return true if push has been handled before. false otherwise.
