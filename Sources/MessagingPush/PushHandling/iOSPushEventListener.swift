 # Why is this class a singleton?
 1. Class stores data that needs to be kept in-memory.

 ---

 # Why is this class not stored in the digraph?

 This class is the SDK's `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` instance.  Meaning, the CIO SDK registers this class with the OS in order to
 receive callbacks when push notifications are interacted with.

 It's important that the instance of this class provided to the OS stays in memory so our SDK can receive those OS callbacks.

 In order to promise this class's singleton instance stays in memory, the singleton instance is *not* stored inside of the digraph (like all other singletons in our SDK is).

 This is a workaound to prevent this scenario:
 - native iOS SDK is initialized.
 - PushEventListener singleton instance is created.
 - PushEventListener singleton instance is registered with the OS to receive push notification callbacks.
 - SDK wrappers re-initialize the native iOS SDK when the SDK wrapper SDK is initialized.
 - During the native iOS SDK's initialization, the SDK's digraph instance is re-created. All objects (and singletons) in that old digraph instance are deleted from memory.
 - That's bad! If the PushEventListener singleton instance was stored in the digraph, it would be deleted from memory. The OS would no longer be able to send push notification callbacks to the SDK.
