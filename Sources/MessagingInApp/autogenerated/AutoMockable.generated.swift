This automatically generated file you are viewing contains mock classes that you can use in your test suite. 

* How do you generate a new mock class? 

1. Mocks are generated from Swift protocols. So, you must make one. 

```
protocol FriendsRepository {
    func acceptFriendRequest<Attributes: Encodable>(attributes: Attributes, _ onComplete: @escaping () -> Void)
}

class AppFriendsRepository: FriendsRepository {
    ...
}
```

2. Have your new protocol extend `AutoMockable`:

```
protocol FriendsRepository: AutoMockable {
    func acceptFriendRequest<Attributes: Encodable>(
        // sourcery:Type=Encodable
        attributes: Attributes, 
        _ onComplete: @escaping () -> Void)
}
```

> Notice the use of `// sourcery:Type=Encodable` for the generic type parameter. Without this, the mock would 
fail to compile: `functionNameReceiveArguments = (Attributes)` because `Attributes` is unknown to this `var`. 
Instead, we give the parameter a different type to use for the mock. `Encodable` works in this case. 
It will require a cast in the test function code, however. 

3. Run the command `make generate` on your machine. The new mock should be added to this file. 

* How do you use the mocks in your test class? 

```
class ExampleViewModelTest: XCTestCase {
    var viewModel: ExampleViewModel!
    var exampleRepositoryMock: ExampleRepositoryMock!
    override func setUp() {
        exampleRepositoryMock = ExampleRepositoryMock()
        viewModel = AppExampleViewModel(exampleRepository: exampleRepositoryMock)
    }
}
```

Or, you may need to inject the mock in a different way using the DI.shared graph:

```
class ExampleTest: XCTestCase {
    var exampleViewModelMock: ExampleViewModelMock!
    var example: Example!
    override func setUp() {
        exampleViewModelMock = ExampleViewModelMock()
        DI.shared.override(.exampleViewModel, value: exampleViewModelMock, forType: ExampleViewModel.self)
        example = Example()
    }
}

```
