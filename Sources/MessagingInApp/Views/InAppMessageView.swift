/**
 View that can be added to a customer's app UI to display inline in-app messages.

 Usage:
 1. Create an instance of this View and add it to the customer's app UI.
 ```
 // you can construct an instance with code:
 let inAppMessageView = InAppMessageView(elementId: "elementId")
 view.addSubView(inAppMessageView)

 // Or, if you use Storyboards:
 @IBOutlet weak var inAppMessageView: InAppMessageView!
 inAppMessageView.elementId = "elementId"
 ```
 2. Position and set size of the View in app's UI. The View will adjust it's height automatically, but all other constraints are the responsibilty of app developer. You can set a height constraint if you want autolayout warnings to go away but know that the View will ignore this set height.
