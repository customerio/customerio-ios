/// `SharedEventBus` is a centralized component that manages event distribution in an application.
/// It allows for the sending of events and the registration of listeners to handle specific event types.
///
/// The EventBus follows a publish-subscribe pattern, enabling loose coupling between event producers and consumers.
///
/// Usage:
/// - To send an event: `eventBus.send(myEvent)`
/// - To listen for an event: `eventBus.onReceive(MyEventType.self) { event in /* handle event */ }`
///
/// Important:
/// - `SharedEventBus` emits `NewSubscriptionEvent` when a new listener subscribes to a specific event type.
///   This allows other parts of the system to react to changes in event listeners.
/// - Be cautious when subscribing to `NewSubscriptionEvent` within its own handler.
///   Creating a new subscription to `NewSubscriptionEvent` in its handler can lead to unintended recursion
///   and should be avoided to prevent potential infinite loops.
///
/// Thread Safety:
/// - `SharedEventBus` is designed to be thread-safe. It ensures that events are sent and listeners are registered
///   in a thread-safe manner.
///
/// Example:
/// ```
/// let eventBus = SharedEventBus(listenersRegistry: ...)
/// eventBus.onReceive(ProfileIdentifiedEvent.self) { event in
///     print("Received ProfileIdentifiedEvent with identifier: \(event.identifier)")
/// }
/// eventBus.send(ProfileIdentifiedEvent(identifier: "user123"))
/// ```
