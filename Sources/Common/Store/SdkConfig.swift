 SDK configuration just for rich push feature of the SDK.

 Construct an instance like you would `SdkConfig`.

 We have a separate SDK config just for rich push because:
 1. Instance of SDK inside of a Notification Service Extension does not have as many features to provide
    compared to running in a host app. Therefore, we don't need to expose as many SDK config options to customers.
 2. The SDK code needs to override some configuration options when running inside of a Notication Service Extension.
    We don't want customers to modify some of these overriden config options as it may effect some features of rich push.

 Note: To not make the SDK code more complex, convert `NotificationServiceExtensionSdkConfig` to an instance of `SdkConfig` when SDK is initialized.
 The SDK should not have conditional logic handling different SDK config objects. The SDK should only have to handle `SdkConfig`.
