 This automatically generated file you are viewing contains mock classes that you can use in your test suite.

 * How do you generate a new mock class?

 1. Mocks are generated from Swift protocols. So, you must make one.

 ```
 protocol FriendsRepository {
     func acceptFriendRequest<Attributes: Encodable>(attributes: Attributes, _ onComplete: @escaping () -> Void)
 }

 class AppFriendsRepository: FriendsRepository {
     ...
 }
 ```

 2. Have your new protocol extend `AutoMockable`:

 ```
 protocol FriendsRepository: AutoMockable {
     func acceptFriendRequest<Attributes: Encodable>(
         // sourcery:Type=Encodable
         attributes: Attributes,
         _ onComplete: @escaping () -> Void)
 }
 ```

 > Notice the use of `// sourcery:Type=Encodable` for the generic type parameter. Without this, the mock would
 fail to compile: `functionNameReceiveArguments = (Attributes)` because `Attributes` is unknown to this `var`.
 Instead, we give the parameter a different type to use for the mock. `Encodable` works in this case.
 It will require a cast in the test function code, however.

 3. Run the command `make generate` on your machine. The new mock should be added to this file.

 * How do you use the mocks in your test class?

 ```
 class ExampleViewModelTest: XCTestCase {
     var viewModel: ExampleViewModel!
     var exampleRepositoryMock: ExampleRepositoryMock!
     override func setUp() {
         exampleRepositoryMock = ExampleRepositoryMock()
         viewModel = AppExampleViewModel(exampleRepository: exampleRepositoryMock)
     }
 }
 ```

 Or, you may need to inject the mock in a different way using the DI.shared graph:

 ```
 class ExampleTest: XCTestCase {
     var exampleViewModelMock: ExampleViewModelMock!
     var example: Example!
     override func setUp() {
         exampleViewModelMock = ExampleViewModelMock()
         DI.shared.override(.exampleViewModel, value: exampleViewModelMock, forType: ExampleViewModel.self)
         example = Example()
     }
 }

 ```
