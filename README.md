# Customer.io iOS SDK

This is the official Customer.io SDK for iOS.

You'll find our [complete SDK documentation at https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/). 

**The SDK has been tested on iOS devices**. It might work on other Apple devices—macOS, tvOS, and watchOS—but we have not officially tested, nor do we officially support, non-iOS devices.

### Migrating from an older SDK version? 

Please follow the relevant migration guide for your current SDK version in our [migration docs](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/migrate-upgrade/).

## Summary

To get started, you need to install and initialize the relevant SDK packages in your project. 

We've separated our SDK into packages to minimize our impact on your app's size. You should only install the packages that you need for your project. 

| Package | Required? | Description |
| :-- | :---: | :--- |
| Tracking | Yes | [`identify`](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/identify/) people/devices and [send events](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/track-events/) (to trigger campaigns, track metrics, etc). |
| MessagingPushAPN | No | [Push](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/push/) and [rich push](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/rich-push/) notifications using Apple's Push Notification service (APNs). |
| MessagingPushFCM | No | [Push](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/push/) and [rich push](https://customer.io/docs/sdk/ios/rich-push/) notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). |
