// Swift Package Manager products are public-facing modules that developers can install into their app. 
// All .library() products will be visible to customers in Xcode when they install our SDK into their app.
// Therefore, it's important that we only expose modules that we want customers to use. Internal modules should not be included in this array.

// When we execute the automated test suite, we use tools to determine the code coverage of our tests. 
// Xcode generates this code coverage report for us, for all of the products in this Package.swift file. 
// It's important that we track the test code coverage of our internal modules, but we don't want to expose internal modules to customers when they install our SDK. 
// Therefore, we dynamically modify the products array to include the internal modules only when executing the test suite and generating code coverage reports.
